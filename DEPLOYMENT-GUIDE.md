## üöÄ Option 1: Manual Deployment (Quick Start)

Perfect for personal projects or quick deployment.

### Step 1: Prepare Your VPS

#### 1.1. Create VPS Instance

Choose your provider and create a server:

**DigitalOcean Example:**

```bash
# Create droplet via web interface
# - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
# - Basic plan ($5/month)
# - Add your SSH key
# - Choose datacenter region
```

**Other Providers:**

- **Linode**: Create Nanode ($5/month)
- **Vultr**: Regular Performance ($5/month)
- **Hetzner**: CX11 (~$3/month)

#### 1.2. Configure Domain (Optional)

```bash
# Add DNS records at your domain registrar
# Type: A Record
# Name: @ (or your subdomain)
# Value: YOUR_VPS_IP
# TTL: 300 (5 minutes)

# For API subdomain:
# Name: api
# Value: YOUR_VPS_IP
```

#### 1.3. Test VPS Access

```bash
# Test SSH connection
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP

# If using SSH key
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_key root@YOUR_VPS_IP
```

### Step 2: Clone and Setup Project

#### 2.1. Clone Repository

```bash
# Clone your repository locally
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

# Or if already cloned, pull latest changes
git pull origin main
```

#### 2.2. Install Prerequisites

```bash
# Run the setup script to install Ansible, Docker, etc.
./scripts/setup.sh

# Follow the prompts to:
# - Install Ansible
# - Install Docker (for local testing)
# - Generate SSH keys
# - Configure system
```

#### 2.3. Copy SSH Key to VPS

```bash
# Copy the generated SSH key to your VPS
ssh-copy-id root@YOUR_VPS_IP

# Or if using custom key
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/github_actions_key.pub root@YOUR_VPS_IP

# Test the connection
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP
```

### Step 3: Deploy Application

#### 3.1. Run Deployment Script

```bash
# Basic deployment with IP address
./scripts/deploy.sh production YOUR_DOMAIN YOUR_VPS_IP

# Example:
./scripts/deploy.sh production api.yourdomain.com 134.122.123.45

# With custom Git repository
./scripts/deploy.sh production api.yourdomain.com 134.122.123.45 https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
```

#### 3.2. Monitor Deployment

The script will:

1. ‚úÖ Test VPS connection
2. ‚úÖ Install system packages and security
3. ‚úÖ Install Docker and dependencies
4. ‚úÖ Clone your application
5. ‚úÖ Build Docker containers
6. ‚úÖ Configure Nginx with SSL
7. ‚úÖ Start all services
8. ‚úÖ Run database migrations

#### 3.3. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check if application is running
curl https://yourdomain.com/health

# Check API endpoints
curl https://yourdomain.com/api

# SSH into server to check logs
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP
docker logs nestjs-app
```

### Step 4: Update Application

#### 4.1. Update Code

```bash
# When you have new code to deploy
./scripts/update.sh production yourdomain.com YOUR_VPS_IP

# Or update from specific branch
./scripts/update.sh production yourdomain.com YOUR_VPS_IP develop
```

#### 4.2. Database Operations

```bash
# SSH into server for database operations
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP
cd /opt/nestjs-blog-api

# Run migrations
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec app npx prisma migrate deploy

# Seed database
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec app npx prisma db seed

# Access database
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec postgres psql -U blog_user -d blog_db
```

## ‚ö° Option 2: Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Recommended for teams and production workflows.

### Step 1: Prepare GitHub Repository

#### 1.1. Fork or Create Repository

```bash
# If forking this repository
# Click "Fork" on GitHub

# If creating new repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

#### 1.2. Create Development Branch

```bash
# Create develop branch for staging deployments
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop
```

### Step 2: Setup VPS Servers

#### 2.1. Create Production Server

Follow Step 1 from Manual Deployment to create your production VPS.

#### 2.2. Create Staging Server (Optional)

```bash
# Create a second VPS for staging
# - Smaller size is fine (512MB RAM)
# - Same OS (Ubuntu 20.04+)
# - Different IP address
```

#### 2.3. Setup SSH Access

```bash
# Generate SSH key specifically for GitHub Actions
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/github_actions_key -N ""

# Copy to both servers
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/github_actions_key.pub root@PRODUCTION_VPS_IP
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/github_actions_key.pub root@STAGING_VPS_IP
```

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Actions

#### 3.1. Run Setup Script

```bash
# Run the interactive setup script
npm run ci:setup

# This will:
# - Generate SSH keys
# - Collect server information
# - Set GitHub secrets automatically
# - Test connections
```

#### 3.2. Manual Secret Configuration (Alternative)

If the script doesn't work, set secrets manually:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"

**Required Secrets:**

```bash
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY          # Content of ~/.ssh/github_actions_key
PRODUCTION_HOST          # Production VPS IP
PRODUCTION_USER          # root (or deploy user)
PRODUCTION_DOMAIN        # yourdomain.com
SSL_EMAIL                # your-email@domain.com

# Optional - for staging
STAGING_HOST            # Staging VPS IP
STAGING_USER            # root (or deploy user)
STAGING_DOMAIN          # staging.yourdomain.com

# Optional - for Docker Hub
DOCKER_USERNAME         # Docker Hub username
DOCKER_PASSWORD         # Docker Hub token
```

**Required Variables:**
Go to Variables tab and add:

```bash
PRODUCTION_DOMAIN       # yourdomain.com
STAGING_DOMAIN          # staging.yourdomain.com (if using staging)
```

#### 3.3. Setup Environment Protection

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environments
2. Create environments:
   - `staging`
   - `production`
3. For production environment:
   - ‚úÖ Add "Required reviewers" (yourself)
   - ‚úÖ Set "Deployment branches" to `main` only
   - ‚úÖ Add wait timer (optional)

### Step 4: Initial Deployment

#### 4.1. Manual Initial Setup

First deployment should be manual to ensure everything works:

```bash
# Deploy to staging first
./scripts/deploy.sh staging staging.yourdomain.com STAGING_VPS_IP

# Then deploy to production
./scripts/deploy.sh production yourdomain.com PRODUCTION_VPS_IP
```

#### 4.2. Test GitHub Actions

```bash
# Test staging deployment
git checkout develop
echo "# Test change" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test staging deployment"
git push origin develop

# Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow run

# Test production deployment
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main

# Approve deployment in GitHub (if protection enabled)
```

### Step 5: Ongoing Development Workflow

#### 5.1. Development Process

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature

# 3. Create Pull Request to develop
# - GitHub will run CI tests
# - Merge when tests pass

# 4. Automatic staging deployment
# - Push to develop triggers staging deployment

# 5. Production deployment
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main
# - Triggers production deployment (with approval)
```

#### 5.2. Manual Deployments

```bash
# Deploy specific branch to production
gh workflow run manual-deploy.yml \
  -f environment=production \
  -f branch=hotfix-urgent-fix

# Deploy to staging from any branch
gh workflow run manual-deploy.yml \
  -f environment=staging \
  -f branch=feature/test-this
```

#### 5.3. Database Operations

```bash
# Run migrations
gh workflow run db-migration.yml \
  -f environment=production \
  -f migration_type=deploy

# Seed database
gh workflow run db-migration.yml \
  -f environment=production \
  -f migration_type=seed

# Reset database (DANGER!)
gh workflow run db-migration.yml \
  -f environment=staging \
  -f migration_type=reset \
  -f confirm_reset=CONFIRM
```
